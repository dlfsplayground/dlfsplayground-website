We are happy to announce that we have secured adequate funding in place for the Allard Playground Expansion. We would like to thank the [City of Edmonton](https://www.edmonton.ca/), [Blackmud Creek Community League](http://www.blackmudcreek.com/), the [Alberta Government](https://www.alberta.ca/) for the New School Playground Grant, and the [Discovery Out Of School Program](https://www.discoveryplacepreschool.com/) for their donations. We are scheduled with City of Edmonton for construction to happen the **summer of 2020**! 



If you would like to donate to allow for some flexibility in funds, we do encourage that, and thank you. These extra funds would allow for unforeseen circumstances to be easier to deal with.  Please contact Philip @ <mailto:dlfsplayground@gmail.com> for details of how to donate.
