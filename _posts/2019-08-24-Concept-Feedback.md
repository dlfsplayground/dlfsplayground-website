The Allard Playground Expansion Committee needs YOUR input this Sunday (Aug 25th, 2019). We have a concept drawing from the city and need feedback from the community.

This Sunday from 11 am to 1 pm we will be at the Heritage Valley Superstore getting your feedback on the playground expansion concept drawing.

Please consider dropping by even if you aren’t shopping to give us feedback. We are making good progress and need your help to keep going. It won’t take much time at all.

Thank you very much!
