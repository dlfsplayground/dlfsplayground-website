It has been a **very exciting week** with the playground construction! Structures are being erected and concreted into the ground.

If you look carefully, you can also see where the poured rubber material is going to be placed - The ground base that is currently higher is where the poured rubber will be, while the lower sections will be wood chips.

We have received word that the park's completion is slated to be **early to mid November**. The expansion will be available to use once the City of Edmonton has approved it. As always, please follow City and Provincial guidelines.


*Due to a number of factors, we are planning to hold the official grand opening in the spring.*

Please continue to follow us for more details.
