Since our funding is now [confirmed]({% post_url 2019-11-30-playground-expansion-funding-update %}), and construction is rapidly scheduled to begin next summer, we require your **urgent** feedback on the desired equipment for the playground. 

We request the following information from families:

* 1-2 pictures (per child) of wanted equipment. (For example, cell phone pictures from other parks, or pictures of equipment found online.)
* Any special needs that your family would like us to take into consideration, or equipment that
  would help any special needs individuals in the community.

Please send this information to [dlfsplayground@gmail.com](mailto:dlfsplayground@gmail.com?subject=Equipment), Subject: "Equipment", prior to **December 8, 2019**.

For complete information please [download](/assets/images/dlfs-playground-equipment-letter.pdf) the Equipment feedback form.

Thank you for your participation,

The DLFS Playground Committee

Note: *While we will try to take into consideration all of the input from community members, at this point we cannot guarantee anything in particular will make it into the final design*.
