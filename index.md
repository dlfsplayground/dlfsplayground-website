The Allard neighbourhood is a new area in south west Edmonton and the home of the [Dr. Lila Fahlman K-9 school](http://lilafahlman.epsb.ca/). The existing playground was installed by the developer, but its current size & design is now insufficient for the nearly 900 students at the school and the community at large. 

Project Goals:
- Expand playground area (approx 500 - 600 sq m)
- Add new equipment aimed at 8-12 yr old children
- Relieve overcrowding, particularly after the pending addition of 4 new portables to the school
